# Detecting Fraud using Tabnet- deep learning for tabular data
Credit card fraud has become ramapant nowadays, with people stealing others information to make purchases and what not. Detecting this fraud is very key, and models have been developed here to do just that. TabNet is the model built to tackle this, tabnet is a deep learning model for tabular data, and it does very well to detect and prevent fraud. The model was compared to logistic regression model and the random forest model, and it shows it does very well in predicting fraud, achieving an over 99% f1 score. Hyperparamter values were not tuned, which would have resulted in more improved performances, and the model was trained for only 20 epochs. Any one who wants more improved performances, can tune hyperparameters and most importantly, train for longer(more epochs).
