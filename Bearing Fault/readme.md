# Detecting Bearing Faults in Motors
### The rising use of smart sensors on the assembly line has resulted in the accumulation of datasets that can reveal important information about machine health. Vibration signal data is a vital and dependable indicator of machine health that can help us better understand the many issues that can arise. Signals data of motor systems are analyzed by extracting useful features from the plethora of signals data recorded. Multiple time and time-frequency domain features are among the features extracted from raw signal data. Statisical features also extracted such as mean, standard deviation and the others. 14 features in total extracted from the raw data of more than 50000 signals. The target label, which is the bearing fault, are of 3 types, 0,1 and 2. Th3 stratfied Kfold validation was used, and the metrics used were the accuracy score and f1 score. 3 machine learning models were used for the modelling, the support vector machine, Decision tree and random forest algorithm. The random forest achieved the highest score with 52.2% accuracy and 51.6% f1 score. The various hyperprameters of the random forest was tuned, and the optimzed model achieved an acccuracy of 52.5% and f1 score of 51.8%. The feature importnace to determine the features that contribute mostly to determining bearing fault was constructed, and absolute mean,var and rms were the top 3 features
